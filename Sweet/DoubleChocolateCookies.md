# Double chocolate cookies

## Ingredients
* 1 cup butter
* 150 grams dark brown sugar
* 200 grams white sugar
* 2 eggs
* 2 tsp vanilla
* 210 grams all-purpose flour
* 100 grams Ghirardelli Majestic cocoa powder (if it feels like a LOT, aim closer to 90 grams)
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 tsp baking soda
* chocolate chips, caramel chips, espresso chips... whatever brings you joy

## Directions
1. Cream butter and sugars.
2. Add eggs and vanilla. 
3. Add the dry ingreidents except the chips, mixing until just barely combined. 
4. Add all the chips you want. Mix it up! I like some semi-sweet, some dark, and some caramel chips. 
5. Scoop onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, and bake for about 12 minutes at 350°. [It's ok if you don't pre-heat your oven.)(https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2023/04/05/you-dont-always-have-to-preheat-your-oven)

## Notes
* A responsible baker combines dry separately. So far sprinkling the salt and baking soda broadly across the flour and cocoa pile is working out for me, so I'll probably just keep not doing that. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
