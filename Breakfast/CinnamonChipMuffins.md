# Cinnamon chip muffins

## Ingredients
* 1 1/2 cups flour
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
* 1 egg, beaten
* 1/2 cup milk
* 1/3 cup vegetable oil
* 1 bag of cinnamon chips

## Directions
1. Whisk the egg, milk and oil. 
2. Normal people with real recipes tell you to mix the dry ingredients separately. Honestly, I just dump it all on top of the wet and mix. Flour first, then sprinkle the other stuff so there isn't a giant clump of baking powder or something. 
2.5. If you need to do it "right," then mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and spices. Then make a well in the dry and pour in the wet. 

Don't overmix. You can never have too-lumpy muffin batter. 
3. Drop a little bit of flour (just 2 tablespoons or so should be plenty) into the bag of cinnamon chips and shake to coat them. That keeps them from sinking. Pour them all into the batter and stir in.
4. Spoon into 12 greased or paper lined muffin cups.

## Note about cinnamon
If your cinnamon is more than a few months old, it’s time to toss it. But buy the new one first and smell the difference. You’ll be astounded. Friends don't let friends use sad cinnamon.
