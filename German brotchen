German brotchen made! Took a couple tries. Salt and pepper on top of these.
These are as close as I've gotten to a typical brotchen in Germany. They passed my German wife test.
500g Flour - Type 550 is what is used in Germany - I used 250g King Arthur AP and 250g King Arthur Bread
300g Water
20g Olive Oil
10g Salt
1g Active Dry Yeast
"No Knead" method
Mix all ingredients until no dry flour remains - I usually do some light kneading in the bowl to ensure it's mixed.
Bulk proof at room temp overnight
Make 90g balls
Proof for 30-40 minutes at room temp
Brush with egg wash (1 Egg white + 1 Tbsp water)
Sprinkle with toppings if desired (Salt/Pepper/Sunflour seeds/Sesame/etc) 
Score one line down the middle
Preheat 450F/Rear/100% Steam
Bake 400F/Rear/100% Steam 10min
Open door to release steam
Bake 450F/Rear/0% Steam 3-7 min until crisp
